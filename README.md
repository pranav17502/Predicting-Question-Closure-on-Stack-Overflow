# Closing the Gap: Predicting Question Closure on Stack Overflow

This was a course project for the course DS 203 - Programming for Data Science in IIT Bombay during Autumn of 2022. 

The data-set is available on kaggle. Link: [Data-set](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/data)


## Features

- Performed extensive exploratory data analysis to bring the text files into understandable format like .csv
- Build models like LSTM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Guassian Naive Bayes, Random Forest and XGBoost
- Achieved 60% accuracy using LSTM, showcasing the better performance of neural networks over other ML Model
- Employed feature engineering and rigorous evaluation to gain insights into question closure dynamics
